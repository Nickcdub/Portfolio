I began solving problems through software after discovering the tediousness of balancing chemical equations in high school chemistry. From there, I didn’t wait for the opportunity to strike me, I decided that in class or not, I wanted to learn more about leveraging software tools and languages to solve problems. Since then, I have graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Systems. I’ve learned so much since that first print(“Hello World!”) and I am excited to find an opportunity to put my knowledge towards solving meaningful problems (beyond high school chemistry).","Throughout my academic journey, I demonstrated my proficiency in utilizing a wide array of technologies effectively, from conception to deployment, crafting comprehensive full-stack applications. These experiences have deepened my technical expertise and enhanced my adaptability to various software environments. Beyond the technical aspects, my time at university was enriched by collaborating with multiple teams across dynamic settings. In these team endeavors, I frequently assumed a proactive role in organizing group activities and effectively delegating tasks. One of, if not the largest takeaway from my education was the importance of listening to and addressing my teammates' concerns with understanding and openness. This skill has not only improved our team dynamics but also significantly enhanced the quality of our collective work.
